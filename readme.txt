Linear Regression: This algorithm is a simple yet powerful tool for predicting stock prices based on historical data. It works by fitting a line to the data and using this line to predict future stock prices.

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): This is a time series model that is commonly used to predict stock prices. It takes into account past values and trends, as well as changes in those trends over time.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): ANNs are a type of machine learning algorithm that are modeled after the structure of the human brain. They are used to analyze large amounts of data and can be used to predict stock prices based on historical data.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs): SVMs are a type of machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression analysis. They are often used in stock prediction models because they are effective at handling non-linear relationships between variables.

Random Forest: This is a machine learning algorithm that works by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is designed to handle sequential data. LSTMs are often used in stock prediction models because they can capture long-term dependencies in the data and make accurate predictions.

Gradient Boosting: This is a machine learning algorithm that works by iteratively improving the performance of a weak learner (e.g., decision tree) by adding new weak learners that are trained to correct the errors of the previous ones.
